Collaborative Graph Authoring

# What?

The first Use Case would be rudimentary collaborative mindmapping.

## How?

### Approach 1 - Not simpler than possible

[share.js](http://sharejs.org/ "share.js") for shared state.

evaluate these graph libraries and pick one

* [arbor.js](https://github.com/samizdatco/arbor "arbor.js")
* [d3.js](http://d3js.org/ "d3.js")
* [sigma.js](http://sigmajs.org/ "sigma.js") 

### Approach 2 - EtherPad Lite

Can this be done as an EtherPad plugin? Or would we need to fork?

### Approach 3 - P2P

Can we build a fully distributed solution?

### Who?

We are just starting from scratch hoping to build somewhat of a community around the concept. Committers are welcome!

### LICENSE

Dont know. A very liberal one.
